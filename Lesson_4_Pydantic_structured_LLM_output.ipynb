      "\n",
      "#### **2. Sentiment and Urgency Analysis**\n",
      "*   **Sentiment:** **Highly Negative**. The customer is justifiably frustrated and dissatisfied. Key indicators are \"cracked,\" \"second time this has happened,\" and the overall tone of the complaint.\n",
      "*   **Urgency:** **High**. The customer explicitly uses the term \"ASAP\" (As Soon As Possible). The repeat nature of the problem escalates the urgency, as the customer's patience and trust are likely exhausted. This query should be prioritized above standard damage claims.\n",
      "\n",

      "*   **Customer Name:** Joe User\n",
      "*   **Customer Email:** joe.user@example.com\n",
      "*   **Order ID:** 12345\n",
      "*   **Purchase Date:** 2025-01-25\n",
      "*   **Issue:** Damaged on Arrival (Cracked Screen)\n",

      "1.  **Prioritize & Escalate:** Tag this ticket as **\"Urgent\"** and **\"Repeat Issue.\"** This is no longer a standard support case; it is a customer retention issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Immediate Replacement Processing:**\n",
      "    *   Do not wait for the customer to return the broken item.\n",
      "    *   Create a new, no-charge order for the same monitor.\n",
      "    *   Upgrade the shipping to the fastest available method (e.g., overnight or 2-day) at no cost to the customer. This demonstrates that you are taking the \"ASAP\" request seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Handle the Return:**\n",
      "    *   Email the customer a pre-paid return shipping label for the damaged monitor.\n",
      "    *   Instruct them they can use the packaging from the new monitor to return the old one, making the process as convenient as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Investigate the Root Cause:**\n",
      "    *   Flag this order and the customer's previous order for review by the logistics or fulfillment department.\n",
      "    *   Possible causes to investigate:\n",
      "        *   **Inadequate Packaging:** Is the protective material insufficient for this specific monitor model?\n",
      "        *   **Carrier Issues:** Is the shipping carrier consistently damaging packages sent to this customer's region?\n",
      "        *   **Warehouse Handling:** Is there a potential issue with how the product is handled before shipping?\n",
      "    *   This internal investigation is crucial to prevent a *third* occurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Follow-up:**\n",
      "    *   After the replacement ships, send a proactive email with the new tracking number.\n",
      "    *   Consider setting a reminder to check in with the customer a day after the replacement is scheduled for delivery to ensure it arrived safely.\n",
